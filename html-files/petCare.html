		    <p class="careText white_text">There are many different types of enclosures you can choose from for your Beardies new home.  The two most common are reptile aquariums and reptile enclosures with sliding front panels. </p>

		    </div>
		    <h3 class="white_text">REPTILE AQUARIUMS</h3>
		    <p class="careText white_text"> Young Beardies under 10 inches in length should be housed in at least a 20 gallon aquarium; however, since Beardies grow fairly quickly a 20 gallon aquarium will only last them for a few months.  The ideal size aquarium for a single adult Bearded Dragon should be nothing smaller than a 40 gallon aquarium. Bearded Dragons like to be able to run around so the bigger the aquarium the better.  55 gallon aquariums are great due to their extra length and they are easily found at most Pet stores.  Screen lids should be used for the top of any aquarium style cages you use as they will allow enough air circulation and will also allow humidity to escape.  </p>
		    <div class="siteImg">
		    	<img class="sitePic" src="../site-images/Front-loading.jpg">
		    </div>
		    <h3 class="white_text">FRONT-LOADING ENCLOSURES</h3>
		    <p class="careText white_text">Young Beardies under 12 inches in length should be housed in reptile cages measuring at least 35” x 12” x 12” in size.  As your Beardie grows it will need a larger enclosure.  A reptile cage measuring at least 50” x 24” x 24” is the perfect size for a single adult Beardie (male or female) or up to three females together.  Ensure there are air vents in the sides or the top of the cage to allow for air circulation and prevent the humidity from getting to high. </p>
		    <p class="careText white_text">Note:  With new baby and juvenile dragons you do not want their enclosure to be to big at first as so much space can be overwhelming to them if they are not use to it.  Also if the enclosure is too big it can make it difficult for young Beardies to find their prey.

		    	<h3 class="white_text">DURING BRUMATION</h3>
		    	<p class="careText white_text">	The only time you may want to adjust your lighting and heat is during a period of Brumation. For information regarding this change, take a look at our Brumation section under <i>Behaviors.</i>
		    	</p>
		    	<h3 class="white_text">LIGHTING</h3>
		    	<p class="careText white_text"> Bearded Dragons require full spectrum lighting for 12-14 hours a day (a timer is a good way to keep light cycle consistent).  The enclosure should be lighted evenly as light stimulates your Beardies appetite.  For lighting use a UVB bulb and ensure that it runs the entire length of the enclosure.  The UVB bulb should be placed over the enclosure or inside the enclosure and not directed through the glass as glass will deflect the UVB rays. In reptiles UVB facilitates the synthesis of vitamin D3, which allows reptiles to process calcium in their systems thus preventing or reversing metabolic bone diseases. For best results your Beardie should be able to come within 8 inches of the UVB bulb. 
		    	</p>
		    	<h3 class="white_text">HEAT</h3>
		    	<p class="careText white_text">Whichever type of enclosure you decide to use the enclosure should have a basking site at one side of the enclosure.  The basking area should have a temperature about 100 degrees Fahrenheit and the opposite side of the enclosure should have a temperature about 85 degrees Fahrenheit (It is a good idea to use a thermometer at the basking site and another one at the cooler end of the enclosure to obtain exact readings).  This difference in temperature allows your Beardie to choose throughout the day where it feels most comfortable.  A 40w light bulb should work fine for the basking site but you may need to adjust the wattage depending on the size of your enclosure, the distance from the bulb to the height of the basking site and the temperature inside your home. 
		    	</p>
		    	<p class="careText white_text">Do not use electric heat rocks, as they can cause severe burns.
		    		
		    	</p>
		    	<p class="careText white_text">The night time temperature should not drop below 65 degrees Fahrenheit, this is important for your Beardies health.  It is usually fairly easy to keep the night temperature above 65 degrees Fahrenheit but if you are having problems you may need to use a ceramic heat emitter or an under tank heater to help keep the temperature from dropping to low as well as providing your Beardie a warm spot to sleep.</p>
		    	
		    </div>
		    <span id="substrate" class="spans"><button class="textReveal">SUBSTRATE AND CLEANING</button></span>
		    <div id="substrateButton" class="hide">
		    	<h3 class="white_text">SUBSTRATE</h3>
		    	<p class="careText white_text">There are many different types of substrate you can choose from for your Beardie.  For hatchlings up to 12 week old Beardies we use no substrate as we find this the safest and easiest for the babies. Food is very easily spotted and there is no chance of impactation.  Without any type of substrate the enclosure should be fully cleaned and sanitized daily and spot cleaned throughout the day as needed.
		    	</p>
		    	<p class="careText white_text">For older beardies you can use Nambia Terra terrarium sand, oat bran, wheat bran, play sand, repti carpet or butcher paper.  We use butcher paper for our adult Beardies as it is safe, cheap and easy to change if there is fecal present (you may have to change the paper several times a day).
		    	</p>
		    	<p class="careText white_text">Washed play sand is also a good choice as it is cheap (can be purchased at most hardware stores for under $10 for 50lbs), looks nice and fecal matter can easily be scooped out as needed.  If using play sand we recommend removing all of the sand once a week and completely cleaning and sanitizing the enclosure then rebedding with new clean play sand.  

		    	</p>
		    	<h3 class="white_text">CLEANING</h3>
		    	<p class="careText white_text">Enclosures are completely cleaned and sterilized at least twice a week (more if needed) with a 10% bleach solution, rinsed well, dried, sprayed with a Professional Coccicidal Concentrated Disinfectant, fully dried again and then lined with butcher paper.
		    	</p>

		    <span id="water" class="spans"><button class="textReveal">WATER</button></span>
		    <div id="waterButton" class="hide">
		    	<h3 class="white_text">WATER</h3>
		    	<p class="careText white_text"> Fresh water should be offered daily in a shallow bowl; however, many Beardies may not drink from a water bowl so you may have to drip the water slowly onto your Beardies nose or wiggle your finger in their water to get their attention.  Another way to get your Beardie to drink is through bathing.  Bathing helps to keep your Beardie hydrated and can also aid in shedding.  Bath water should be warm but not hot and should be no deeper than half the length of your Beardies front arms.  If your Beardie still won’t drink you may have to drip the water slowly onto your Beardies nose, wiggle your finger in their water, or create ripples in the water to get their attention.  Never leave your Beardie alone in the bath as accidents only take a second to happen.  Beardies also often defecate in water so you may need to change the bath water and bathe them again. Water bowls should be disinfected at least once a week, more if needed due to the Beardie defecating in it, to avoid bacterial build-up.

		    <div id="furnitureButton" class="hide">
		    	<p class="careText white_text">Cage furniture should be kept to a minimum for baby dragons as babies find their prey much easier in an uncomplicated setup and it gives prey little opportunity to hide.  As your dragon becomes older feel free to make a more interesting habitat, a wood branch or a rock at the basking site, their veggie bowl, a hammock to lay on or under and maybe another rock or branch at the cooler end of the enclosure.  When cleaning your Beardies enclosure be sure to clean and sanitize all of the furniture/rocks as well.

		    <span class="spans"><button class="textReveal">OVERVIEW</button></span>
		    <div class="hide">
			 	<p class="careText white_text"> Bearded Dragons are omnivores, meaning they eat both meat and vegetable matter. The diets differ greatly depending on the age of your dragon.  A hatchling dragon will eat mostly small insects and should be fed 3-5 times daily (if insufficient food is fed baby dragons may nip at the tails and toes of their cage mates).  A juvenile dragon’s (2-4 months of age) diet should consist of approximately 80% insects and 20% greens. A juvenile dragon should be fed insects 2-3 times daily and greens may be left in their cage at all times.  As your bearded dragon grows into an adult their diet will gradually change from consisting primarily of insects to consisting primarily of greens. 
			   </p>
		   		<p class="careText white_text"> Be sure the size of food you feed your dragon is proportional to its size.  A good rule is the food/insects should be no bigger than the space between the dragon’s eyes.   If the food /insects are too large for the dragon to properly digest it can cause the dragon to regurgitate the food which can lead to malnourishment or it could cause intestinal blockages which can lead to seizures.
		   		</p>
		   		<p class="careText white_text">To avoid low calcium in the diet feeder insects should be lightly coated with a calcium supplement (powdered calcium carbonate or calcium gluconate) at every feeding.  You should feed your feeder insects a nutritious and vitamin rich diet since what your feeder insects eat your dragon will ultimately eat.   This nutritious and vitamin rich diet is often times referred to as “gut-loading”.   There are some companies who manufacture specially formulated gut-load feed for your insects which you can purchase and feed to your insects and you are done.  Another way to gut-load your insects is to feed them everyday food items that your most likely already have in your home such as: corn meal, oats, carrots, potatoes, bananas, or apples.
		   		</p>
		   		<p class="careText white_text">Plant matter should consist mainly of green leafy vegetables. You may also include other vegetables and fruits. Vegetables and fruits will have a high water content so feed in small quantities to avoid diarrhea.  If you’re keeping your bearded dragon on a sand based substrate then you will want to keep the vegetables and fruit in a high rim bowl to avoid them from getting sand all over those sticky, juicy pieces of food.   Vegetables and fruits should be cut or torn into small pieces proportional to the size of the dragon.  It is a good idea to mix the vegetables and fruit with the greens when feeding your dragon.  This will encourage the dragon to not only try new foods but also encourage them to eat a little of everything instead of just picking out their favorite foods and leaving the rest. Remember the trick to vegetables and fruits is variation and moderation!
		   		</p>
		   		<p class="careText white_text">In the wild bearded dragons munch on worms, spiders, moths, crickets, grubs and more.  They get a huge variety to choose from, much like you would at a buffet.  So if you want to have the happiest and healthiest bearded dragons what you want to do is stimulate this natural variety in their diet.  Feed them as many different healthy things as you can find at the pet store or online and create your own critter buffet for them to enjoy.

		    		<li>Apples - occasionally but remove the peel first.</li>
					<li>Asparagus - occasionally and a good source of protein for younger dragons.</li>
					<li>Bananas – sparingly, they’re high in phosphorus which binds with calcium and can cause Metabolic Bone Disease (MBT), so should be fed rarely.</li>
					<li>Basil - daily a few fresh leaves are a great source of calcium and vitamin A.</li>
					<li>Beetroot/beet greens - rarely, high water and oxalic acid content so very small amounts only (oxalic acid binds with calcium).</li>
					<li>Bell Peppers - occasionally, red peppers may interest your bearded dragons more than the green and are higher in vitamin C to offset the content of oxalic acid.</li>
					<li>Blackberries - occasionally, should be fed as a treat due to calcium to phosphorus ratio and oxalic acid but good source of vitamin C.</li>
					<li>Blueberries – occasionally, moderate oxalates</li>
					<li>Broccoli - rarely. Very high in vitamin C but also contains oxalates and goitrogen.</li>
					<li>Brussel Sprouts - rarely, high in vitamins but also has goitrogen.</li>
					<li>Cabbage - rarely but can cause Anaemia, best fed to the insects due to lower vitamin content when compared to sprouts.</li>
					<li>Carrots - occasionally, really high in vitamin A which offsets the oxalates in them.</li>
					<li>Cauliflower - rarely in small amounts as it contains goitrogens which block iodine intake which potentially can cause issues with the Thyroid Gland as a result</li>
					<li>Cauliflower leaves - occasionally, but better fed to the insect.</li>
					<li>Celery - occasionally – quite fiberous so very finely chop it up to avoid digestive issues.</li>
					<li>Cherry Tomatoes - rarely but high acid content so small pieces – also it’s best to leave the seeds/ juice out if not hand feeding.</li>
					<li>Collard Greens – daily, great staple, high calcium, moderate oxalates.</li>
					<li>Cranberries - occasionally, high in fibre and almost even mix of calcium and phosphorus.</li>
					<li>Cucumbers - occasionally but not much nutritional value, better as a source of water.</li>
					<li>Dandelions/Dandelion Greens – daily, a great source of calcium and vitamin A in the leaves but be very careful of pesticides. Flowers are also edible.</li>
					<li>Eggs – Hardboiled only, in small quantities rarely as a treat.</li>
					<li>Grapes - occasionally, green or red probably best to cut the grapes in small pieces. Good for fiber and water, but high in sugars and oxalates.</li>
					<li>Kale - occasionally – high in calcium and vitamin A but also high in goitrogens and oxalates.</li>
					<li>Mustard Greens – daily, high in vitamins A and C, moderate oxalates, goitrogens</li>
					<li>Pears - occasionally but high in oxalic acid.</li>
					<li>Peas - rarely since it has a very high phosphorus to calcium ratio. Better off feeding them the leaves and pods which are much safer.</li>
					<li>Pineapple – occasionally, moderate oxalates</li>
					<li>Pumpkin - occasionally, most squashes seem to be fine and high in fibre, vitamin A and calcium.</li>
					<li>Rocket - daily.</li>
					<li>Rose petals - occasionally, they tend to love these but remember that any fertilizers/ pesticides in the soils will be in the flowers.</li>
					<li>Strawberries - occasionally – dragons will end up looking like they’re wearing lipstick which is quite amusing.</li>
					<li>Squash – daily, high in fiber and vitamin A.</li>

					<li>Crickets - daily. Black or brown crickets, remember to dust a few every few days – more often for babies. Also gut load them e.g. feed them vegetables an hour before feeding to the lizard. Best bet is to buy them live rather than frozen, always get them from pet shops or suppliers rather than from the wild.</li>
					<li>Dubia – daily, have 7 times the nutritional benefits of any other feeder insect and carry no parasites like crickets.</li>
					<li>Hornworms – occasionally, high in calcium, low in fat and have no chitin or exoskeleton so your animal has no worry of impaction. Their bright green/turquoise color stimulates the pickiest eaters and keeps them looking for more.</li>
					<li>Locusts – daily, You must always gut load the locusts as without them feeding on greens they have very little nutrition for the dragon. Remember to frequently dust with calcium as well.</li>
					<li>Mealworms - infrequent, high in fat and phosphorates, but low in calcium – dust them with calcium and they’re good as a supplement for dragons to put on some weight. Avoid feeding them mealworms that are due to malt as the hard skin/ chitin will cause digestive issues.</li>
					<li>Mice - very rarely as a treat but only pinkie mice and only for fully grown adult bearded dragons.</li>
					<li>Silkworms – occasionally, most nutritional commercial feeder insect you can give to your pets as they have  high source of Calcium, Protein, Iron, Magnesium, Sodium, and Vitamins B1, B2, and B3. The silkworm's size, color, and soft body make them irresistible to animals.</li>
					<li>Superworms – infrequently, high in fat and phosphorates, but low in calcium – dust them with calcium and they’re good as a supplement for dragons to put on some weight.  They are much like mealworms only larger and contain less chitin (the stuff that makes the shells hard) than mealworms, making them easier for your animals to digest.</li>

		    	<p class="careText white_text">Bearded Dragons can cohabitate with one another but there are some guidelines to follow to ensure the safety of all Beardies.  Beardies that cohabitate together must be of the same size.  Never keep a baby Beardie with an adult or sub-adult as the larger dragon will make no distinction between the baby and its prey.  When keeping two or more babies together it is not unusual for them to grow at different paces.  This difference in growth if often times due to bullying which can cause a smaller dragon to stop feeding.  If this happens you must separate them to give the smaller dragon a chance. Babies of both sexes can live together until about 3 months of age or until the male Beardies start showing signs of aggression/mating or become territorial.  You can never keep two adult males in one enclosure, they are very territorial and will fight, which can lead to serious injury.  Female Beardies are fine living with one another as long as they are all around the same size.
		    	</p>
		    	<p class="careText white_text">Bearded dragons are not social animals, but will sometimes gather in groups, especially in popular feeding or basking areas. At these times, a distinct hierarchy will emerge: the highest-ranking animals will take the best - usually the highest or sunniest - basking spots, and all other individuals arrange themselves lower down. If a low-ranking animal tries to challenge one of the dominant dragons, the dominant animal will demonstrate its superiority by bobbing its head and inflating its beard, at which point the challenger may signal submission by waving one of its forelegs in a slow circle. If the low-ranking dragon does not submit, it will return the head bob, and a stand off or fight may ensue.

It is a time when your Beardie will stop eating, become lethargic, and possibly try to burrow for a time. Then they will sleep. And sleep. And. Sleep. This instinctive behaivior, similar to hibernation in mamals, evolved for Beardies to survive the colder months of their native environments. Through metabolism supression, they are able to survive decreased solar temperatures and lack of available food and water. Your Beardie can go into Brumation despite your strict adherence to proper Enclosure standards, and can remain in this state for more than 3 months. 
		    	</p>
		    	<p class="careText white_text">	However, you can redeuce or remove your lighting during Brumation, provided that you maintain an enclosure  temperature above 65 degrees. If your beardie is in a room with lots of artificial light, you should cover their enclosure. Be sure to continue to monitor the temperature and check on your Beardie every few days.

		    	<h3 class="white_text">YOUR NEW BEARDIE</h3>
		    	<p class="careText white_text">When a Beardie (especially a baby) arrives in its new home it will most likely be stressed and frightened.  This behavior is normal and should only last for a day or two.  During this time period your Beardie may not eat and may hiss at you if you try to handle it.  To help make the adjustment for your Beardie easier we recommend not to handle your new Beardie too much for the first few days as this will only stress it out more.  In addition try to keep your new Beardie in a relatively quiet place and give it time to adjust to its new home and feel safe.   Up until now your Beardie has been in a cage with at least five other Beardies in a calm and quite environment with minimal handling.  Now they are all alone in a new environment…this is a big change for a little Beardie and it can be extremely stressful for them. Since Beardies are not very vocal animals instead they communicate through color displays and physical gestures.
		    	</p>
		    	<h3 class="white_text">COLOR DISPLAYS</h3>
		    	<ul class="careText white_text">
		    		<li>Vivid Color and white belly - happy</li>
		    		<li>Dark markings and spots on its belly – Not happy, stressed</li>
		    	</ul>
		    	<h3 class="white_text">BEARD DISPLAY</h3>
		    	<p class="careText white_text">All Beardies will display this behavior but males have much larger beards. Both male and female beards turn black when displayed (males are much darker and some times the darkness spreads down to their shoulders). However, there are several reason for this diplay:
		    	</p>
		    	<ul class="careText white_text">
		    		<li>Aggression- Your Beardie is feeling threatened, or wants to assert dominance.</li>
		    		<li>Displays for mating purposes</li>
		    		<li>"Morning exercises"- This is a way your Beardie may stretch in the morning. It is often seen as short, repeated puffing of the beard, and may not include a drakened color.</li>
		    		<li>Shedding- This looks similar to morning exercising. It is a way for your Beardie to break loose the old skin from the spikes around its' head. </li>
		    	</ul>
		    	<h3 class="white_text">PHYSICAL GESTURES</h3>
		    	<ul class="careText white_text">
		    		<li>HEAD BOBBING– There are several different kinds of head bob gestures:</li>
		    			<ul>
		    				<li>Slow bowing motion - used by both adult males and females to signal submission (often accompanied by a slow arm wave)</li>
		    				<li>Fast bob – used by males to signal dominance (often accompanied by an inflated and/or blackened beard)</li>
		    				<li>Violent bob - used by males just before mating, much more vigorous, and usually sets the animal's whole body in motion</li>
		    			</ul>
		    		<li>ARM WAVE– A sign of submission. When they wave, they are saying “Peace. I bring you no harm”. Males and females will wave to show submission to a more dominant dragon.  The male will only wave to show submission to another dominant male, whereas the female will wave, followed by a slow head bob, to show she is ready to mate. Gravid (pregnant) females will often refuse the advances of a male by chasing him and lying on his back.  </li>
		    		<li>PUSH-UPS- Sometimes females display what looks to be a push-up in response to male dragons' head bobs. Most of the time this is seen during breeding season. </li>
		    		<li>Tail up or twitching-If the tail is up or twitching it usually means the Beardie is hunting. Sometimes their tail will twitch when they are watching their prey before they give chase. </li>
		    		<li>MOUTH GAPING- In a healthy dragon, this behavior is normal. They gape their mouth open to release heat for the same reason a dog pants to cool down. Beardies do not sweat, so they do this to release heat. But, at other times it can be a sign of illness if accompanied by lethargy, nasal discharge, or lack of appetite. You might want to do further research about respiratory infections in Bearded Dragons.</li>
		    		<li>HISSING- Sometimes when startled, both the male & the female will display their beards,open their mouths, and make a kind of hissing noise. This is a defense warning. Don't be alarmed, Beardies will hardly ever act on their threats. It's usually all show and no bite.</li>
		    		<li>DIGGING- It's a fact of life - Dragons dig. They may dig a hole to sleep in, and to get out of the sun. Females dig burrows to lay eggs and this is totally normal. They may also try to dig a sleeping burrow when it's time to brumate.</li>

		    	</ul>
		    	<p class="careText white_text"> In order to interpret your Beardie's display, consider the stimuli surrounding it. If you have a male and female that can see each other, they may be signaling back and forth. If YOU are sporting a beard yourself, your Beardie might interpret it as aggression, and respond with it's own beard, or possibly show submission through arm waving.

		    <span class="spans"><button class="textReveal">HANDLING YOUR BEARDIE</button></span>
		    <div class="hide">
		    	<p class="careText white_text"> When handling your Beardie, you should first consider his or her temperament prior to removing them from the enclosure. If they seem defensive or evasive, perhaps spend a few minutes letting them get used to your presence before picking them up, or leave them along and try again later. <span class="caution"><i>DO NOT</i></span> pick up your Beardie by the limbs or tail! Even if you feel you are being careful doing this, a sudden movoment by your Breadie can lead to severe injury. Instead, slide a hand under their rib cage and abdomen and continue until at least one set of feet is on your hand, and support their tail on your arm. Use your other hand to cover their back. This will help prevent your Beardie from lunging off of your hand onto the floor, and may make them feel more secure. For baby, or jeuvenile Beardies, the "cave" you are making with your hands may feel like a burrow, and therefore offering them more comfort. If you lan to keep them out for an extended period of time, you might want to consider placing them in a warm bath to stimulate bowel evacuation prior to putting them on your furniture.
		    	</p>
		    	<p class="careText white_text">For the Beardie on the go, a harness is strongly recommended. This can allow you to place your Beardie on you arm or shoulder and move hands-free, safe in the knowledge that your Beardie has the propper support should they slip from their perch.
